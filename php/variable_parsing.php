// PHP strings allow us to place variables directly into double quoted strings. The computer will read the variables as the value they hold rather than see them as just a sequence of characters.

  $noun = "space";
  $adjective = "yellow";
  $verb = "sing";

  echo "The world's most beloved $noun was very $adjective and loved to $verb every single day.";

 echo "\nI have always been obsessed with ${noun}s. I'm ${adjective}ish. I'm always ${verb}ing."; 
 // Prints : I have always been obsessed with spaces. I'm yellowish. I'm always singing.

// yea as u can c, u can add some words behind the variable using curly braces ({..})
//mwehehehehe so funny coz thats nonsense
